#  - kodi-inputstream-*           input stream add-ons
#  - kodi-peripheral-joystick     enables the use of gamepads, joysticks, game controllers, etc.
#  - kodi-pvr-*                   PVR add-ons
#  - pulseaudio                   in case the user prefers PulseAudio instead of ALSA
#  - tzdata                       necessary for timezone selection
